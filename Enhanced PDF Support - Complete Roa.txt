 Enhanced PDF Support - Complete Roadmap

  Here's what we can implement for world-class PDF processing:

  📋 Phase 1: Core PDF Processing

  🔧 Browser-Compatible PDF Engine

  // Using PDF.js (Mozilla's library)
  - Text extraction from PDF documents
  - Page-by-page processing
  - Font and layout information preservation
  - Coordinate-based text positioning

  Benefits:
  - ✅ Works in all browsers
  - ✅ No server-side dependencies
  - ✅ Handles complex PDF layouts
  - ✅ Maintains text positioning data

  ---
  📋 Phase 2: Smart Table Detection

  🧠 Algorithm-Based Table Recognition

  // Smart table detection using:
  1. Column alignment analysis
  2. Whitespace pattern recognition
  3. Header detection (keywords like "Item", "Price", "Qty")
  4. Row boundary identification
  5. Cell content classification

  Features:
  - 📊 Automatic column mapping
  - 🎯 Header row detection
  - 📏 Dynamic column width handling
  - 🔄 Multi-page table continuation

  ---
  📋 Phase 3: Invoice Pattern Recognition

  🎯 AI-Powered Data Extraction

  // Pattern matching for common invoice formats:
  - GST invoices (India)
  - Standard purchase orders
  - Supplier invoices
  - Bill of materials
  - Retail receipts

  Smart Recognition:
  - 🏷️ Supplier names (from headers/letterheads)
  - 📦 Product descriptions (with fuzzy matching)
  - 💰 Price extraction (multiple currencies)
  - 📊 Quantity detection (units, pieces, kg, etc.)
  - 📅 Date parsing (multiple formats)
  - 🏷️ Tax/GST handling

  ---
  📋 Phase 4: OCR for Scanned PDFs

  👁️ Optical Character Recognition

  // Using Tesseract.js for browser-based OCR:
  - Image-based PDF processing
  - Multiple language support
  - Preprocessing for better accuracy
  - Confidence scoring for extracted text

  Capabilities:
  - 📷 Scanned document support
  - 🌍 Multi-language recognition
  - 🔍 Image preprocessing (contrast, rotation)
  - ✨ Text confidence scoring

  ---
  📋 Phase 5: User Experience Enhancements

  🎨 Interactive PDF Processing

  Preview & Correction Interface:

  // Real-time preview with editing capabilities:
  1. PDF thumbnail view
  2. Extracted data preview
  3. Field-by-field correction
  4. Mapping confirmation
  5. Bulk edit options

  Smart Suggestions:

  // AI-powered suggestions:
  - Auto-complete for supplier names
  - Price validation (reasonable ranges)
  - Duplicate detection
  - Category suggestions
  - Unit standardization

  🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan

  Option 1: Client-Side Processing (Recommended)

  # Dependencies to add:
  npm install pdf-parse-fork pdfjs-dist tesseract.js

  Advantages:
  - ⚡ Fast processing (no server calls)
  - 🔒 Privacy-focused (data stays local)
  - 💰 No server costs
  - 🌍 Works offline

  Option 2: Hybrid Approach

  # For complex processing:
  - Client-side for simple PDFs
  - Server-side API for complex documents
  - OCR processing in background
