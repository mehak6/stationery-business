# Party Purchases Data Persistence Fix

## Problem Identified âœ…

**Issue**: Party purchases data was disappearing when reopening the application.

**Root Cause**: The `party_purchases` table had Row Level Security (RLS) policies that only allowed `authenticated` users to access data, but the application runs with anonymous access.

## The Fix ðŸ”§

### What was wrong:
```sql
-- Old restrictive policy (WRONG)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON party_purchases
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### What it should be:
```sql
-- New policies allowing anonymous access (CORRECT)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view party purchases" ON party_purchases
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can create party purchases" ON party_purchases
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
    
-- ... etc for UPDATE and DELETE
```

## How to Apply the Fix ðŸš€

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Open SQL Editor**
3. **Run the script**: `fix_party_purchases_permissions.sql`

## Files Updated:
- âœ… `supabase_party_purchases.sql` - Updated with correct permissions
- âœ… `fix_party_purchases_permissions.sql` - Standalone fix script

## Result:
- âœ… Party purchases will now **persist** across app sessions
- âœ… Data will **not disappear** when reopening the application  
- âœ… Anonymous users can read/write party purchase data
- âœ… Matches the permission pattern used by products table

## Note for Production:
In a production environment, implement proper authentication and restrict these permissions based on user roles for better security.
